# yelp_review_useful
Consumers are dependent on online directory websites such as Yelp on a daily basis to find a reasonable service provider, be it a dentist or a good restaurant for dinner! Yelp most primarily focuses on simple reviews and ratings which means consumers might have to sift through dozens of reviews to find a good business. Yelp gets constant feedback on the  usefulness of the reviews posted by allowing users to vote the review “useful”. However, this would mean multiple users sifting through them and providing a feedback. The goal of the project is to predict the number of “useful” votes a review will get and thereby have them higher up the review listings. By implementing this project we aim to get an understanding of how to approach a real world business problem with traditional machine learning algorithms to gain useful insights.
